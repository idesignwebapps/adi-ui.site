        <p>Top Gun is a cinematic souvenir. Defending it as a work of art would be either brave or reckless. As an

            artifact though, it&apos;s peerless. A solid 4&sol;5"</p>

                Adi&apos;s Review
            </h2>
            <p>
                Top Gun is a cinematic masterpiece. It is not just about the nostalgia, but also the quality in
                production. The fact that the movie was shot on actual fighter jets back in the 80&apos;s still amazes
                me. Growing up an Air Force family always found me near fighter aircrafts since my childhood.

                Dogfights and cockpit viewpoints with real filmed aviation stunts brings the audience right into the sky
                and leaves you breathless and exhilarated. There is a very good balance of action and character
                development in this film, which is pacey and well timed throughout. A small number of humorous moments
                are tasteful and not overdone.

                Tom Cruise is absolutely fabulous and breathtaking in every way. The plane action sequences are
                thrilling and always have me on the edge of my seat. The movie also has some deep emotional moments
                which
                balance out the fairly simple tone. Top Gun is truly entertaining throughout and if you didn&apos;t like
                Tom Cruise before this, you&apos;d definitely love him now.
