        <h2>Good Approach</h2>
        <p>While not being much of a gamer myself, I have always liked the way Microsoft had approached their controller
            designs with XBOX. The controller designed by Sony for the Playstation consoles were never the way to go, in
            my opinion.</p>

        <h2>Ergonomic Design</h2>
        <p>The ergonomic design makes this controller so comfortable to hold. It gives the feeling of holding a really
            well designed mouse. Using the controller for long hours is such a fine experience that the user almost
            forgets about holding it while being immersed in the gaming session. The design is well made for the
            placement of the thumbs as well as all of the other fingers. Even with slippery hands, its quite easy to
            have a firm grip on the product.

        <h2>Competition with PS5</h2>
        <p>A fun fact though; The controller on the Playstation 5 (PS5) is a good example of a brand implementing good
            design, as they are built ergonomically to directly compete with the XBOX controller. Sony was quick to
            realise the better design given by Microsoft, and took inspiration for their next iteration of consoles.</p>
