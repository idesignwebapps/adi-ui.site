        <h2>Simple Design</h2>
        <p>I had purchased this from IKEA back in India and I've got to say it was a precious buy for me.</p>
        <p>Being forced to keep my headphones on the desk, constantly fearing my headphones to get damaged or dirty,
            made me look for a stand. There were many such stands on the market, some having the RGB color lighting
            setup as well.</p>

        </figure>
        <h2>Amazing Build</h2>
        <p>But what I liked about this particular one was:
        <ul>
            <li>Make : It is made out of a metal which makes it sturdy and long-lasting.</li>
            <li>Shape : As visible in the images, my headphones can easily fit on the ledge at the top of the stand.
            </li>
            <li>Simplicity : Its a simple shape, and also gives the product user option to keep a phone docked (although
                I
                have placed my earbuds there in the pictures).</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Matches Desk Setup</h2>
        <p>And lastly, one of the other reasons for my purchase was the fact that the color and design suited
            my desk setup.</p>
