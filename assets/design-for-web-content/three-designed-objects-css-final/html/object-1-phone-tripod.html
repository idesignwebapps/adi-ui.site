        <h2>Intriguing Design</h2>
        <p>Here's my recent and a very valuable purchase that I absolutely adore to have. This particular tripod is a
            multi-utility product which I end up using every day.</p>
        <p>The design is quite intriguing. It starts out folded, being the size of an umbrella handle which makes it
            portable. Once the phone holder part is folded out, the product can be used as a pretty stable selfie-stick.
            It also comes with a bluetooth remote to be able to click selfies, which is an added bonus.</p>

        <h2>Very Convenient</h2>
        <p>With a small press of a finger at the bottom, the legs of the tripod can be brought out to convert the
            product into a stand. Its very convenient when it comes to making video calls back home (especially when my
            Mum's guiding me through a recipe). Then you can adjust the height of the tripod by pulling the stand up and
            it stretches out above waist height quite easily, which is quite helpful when it comes to clicking pictures
            of the sky at night, and other landscapes.</p>

        <h2>Accessible</h2>
        <p>Easy to hold, and an easier to understand operation even without reading the manual, and not to mention that
            it can be used by left-handed and right-handed users likewise. This makes it a good product of
            design in my books.</p>
