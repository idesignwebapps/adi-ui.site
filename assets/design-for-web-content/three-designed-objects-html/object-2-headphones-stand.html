    <h1>Object 2 : Headphones Stand</h1>
    <p>I had purchased this from IKEA back in India and I've got to say it was a precious buy for me.</p>
    <p>Being forced to keep my headphones on the desk, constantly fearing my headphones to get damaged or dirty, made me
        look for a stand. There were many such stands on the market, some having the RGB color lighting setup as well.
        But what I liked about this particular one was:
    <ul>
        <li>Make : It is made out of a metal which makes it sturdy and long-lasting.</li>
        <li>Shape : As visible in the images, my headphones can easily fit on the ledge at the top of the stand.</li>
        <li>Simplicity : Its a simple shape, and also gives the product user option to keep a phone docked (although I
            have placed my earbuds there in the pictures).</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        And lastly, one of the other reasons for my purchase was the fact that the color and design suited
        my desk setup.
