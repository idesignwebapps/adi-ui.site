    <h1>Object 3 : XBOX Controller</h1>
    <p>While not being much of a gamer myself, I have always liked the way Microsoft had approached their controller
        designs
        with XBOX. The controller designed by Sony for the Playstation consoles were never the way to go, in my opinion.
    </p>
    <p>The ergonomic design makes this controller so comfortable to hold. It gives the feeling of holding a really well
        designed mouse. Using the controller for long hours is such a fine experience that the user almost forgets about
        holding
        it while being immersed in the gaming session. The design is well made for the placement of the thumbs as well
        as all of the other fingers. Even with slippery hands, its quite easy to have a firm grip on the product.</p>
    <p>A fun fact though; The controller on the Playstation 5 (PS5) is a good example of a brand implementing good
        design,
        as they are built ergonomically to directly compete with the XBOX controller. Sony was quick to realise the
        better design
        given by Microsoft, and took inspiration for their next iteration of consoles.</p>
