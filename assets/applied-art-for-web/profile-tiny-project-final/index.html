        <h3>I : About Me</h3>
        <p>I'm from Bangalore, the Silicon Valley or Garden City of India. I am a UI/UX Developer currently pursuing
            Master of Arts in Web Design and Content Planning at University of Greenwich, London.</p>
        <p>I completed my first degree in Computer Science in 2019. I carry about two and a half years of experience as
            a Web Developer and UI Educator at Infosys, an Multinational Corporation based in India.</p>
        <p>While I was introduced to Front-end development at work, I found the idea of UX and Design fascinating to
            change
            gears to, especially to excel my UI/UX stack, and hence decided pursue my master&apos;s degree in Web
            Designing.

        <h3>II : Travel Enthusiast</h3>
        <p>I come from a humble background, and have shared a good chunk of my life living with my family. My father has
            a transferable job, and consequently I have changed over 9 schools all across different parts of India.</p>
        <p> While not ideal, this lifestyle has given me the opportunity to travel all across my country. From the
            touristy to the less travelled places. From depths of mountainous forests to serene beaches. From snowy tops
            to desert sand dunes. I take all the opportunities to be able to visit and feel places.
            It is a learning experience like no other, especially in my country which is rich in heritage, culture,
            languages and everything in between.</p>

        <h3>III : Formula 1 Fan</h3>
        <p>I have always loved motor-sports, Formula 1 more than others. Formula 1 has been the leader in making
            technology reach its pinnacle. “It is a theatre on wheels, a spectacle” as it is often said.</p>
        <p>I came in as a clueless viewer cheering on for Fernando Alonso and Ferrari team back in 2010. Soon, the
            sport got me hooked on for as long it has been. The technological developments in F1 over the years has been
            tremendous and has helped those advancements to roll-over to factory production to make our automotive
            experience better in day-to-day life.</p>

        <h3>IV : Aviation Nerd</h3>
        <p>Talking about my love for technology and travel, there&apos;s a small addition to the things I am an absolute
            nerd
            about. Coming from an Air Force background back in my country, I basically happened to have grown up with
            aeroplanes. I take interest in both military and commercial jets.</p>
        <p>I have spent a good amount of time on flight simulators since childhood. Having set-up an Airbus A320
            simulator at home, and imitating real life procedures for aviation communications, taxi, take-off, cruise
            and landing is something I have always enjoyed as a hobby.</p>
        <p>I do aspire to be at the controls of a jet in real life someday.</p>

        <h3>V : Animal Lover</h3>
        <p>Animals and Nature are things that I like being close to, with a special love for Dogs, Cats, and more.</p>
        <p>I have a Labrador Retriever, and his name is Zeus. He&apos;s about 12 years old now and is absolutely
            adorable.
            You cannot go wrong with his cuteness.</p>
        <p>I have spent a lot of time researching the Bengal Tigers and Cheetahs. Studied the conservation efforts
            behind these majestic species, visited National Parks and Tiger Reserves, and simply watched a lot of videos
            over at National Geographic and Discovery Channel.</p>

        <h3>VI : Ukulele Player</h3>
        <p>In early 2021 during the COVID pandemic, I had an urge to learn a string-based instrument. I have always been
            an amateur piano player, and it was time to add something new to that list.</p>
        <p>I picked up my first Ukulele to learn my favourite songs and it was a huge struggle outright. Purchased as a
            stress buster, the first few days sure were frustrating. I have been in the process of perfecting my skills,
            spending a lot of time practising new and more difficult songs. Ever since, I have purchased my second
            Ukulele which is made out of Mahogany and surely is one of my most valuable possessions.</p>
