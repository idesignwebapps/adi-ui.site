                <h3>I : Top Gun School is Real</h3>
                <p>The United States Navy Strike Fighter Tactics Instructor program, also known as TOPGUN, is a
                    real-life training school for elite fighter pilots.</p>
                <p>The school was established in 1969 to teach advanced tactics to fighter pilots, and it has since
                    become world-renowned for producing some of the best fighter pilots in the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The program is highly selective, and pilots must have at least 1,250 flight hours and be in the top
                    10% of their fleet before they can even apply to attend. Once selected, they must undergo rigorous
                    training that includes classroom instruction, simulation exercises, and actual flight missions. The
                    training focuses on advanced fighter tactics, including air combat maneuvering, air-to-ground
                    attack, and long-range interception.

                <h3>II : Crazy Credits</h3>
                <p>The opening credits sequence features a history of the Top Gun program before the title of the film
                    appears on screen, with the remainder of the opening credits devoted to footage of planes being
                    launched from and landing on an aircraft carrier.</p>
                <p> Following the pictures of actors in the film in the closing credits, a brief shot is shown of two
                    F-14s flying by amidst a red sky with a mountain in the background. The closing credits play over
                    this mountain sunset scenery.</p>

                <h3>III : Tom Cruise did his own stunts</h3>
                <p>Tom Cruise is known for performing many of his own stunts in his movies, and Top Gun is no exception.
                    In the film, Cruise&apos;s character Maverick is shown piloting an F-14 Tomcat fighter jet, and many
                    of the aerial sequences were filmed with real planes and pilots.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cruise underwent extensive training in order to be able to perform some of the more challenging
                    flying scenes himself. He spent months learning how to fly in a simulator, and then went through
                    actual flight training in a T-38 Talon, a supersonic jet used for pilot training.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the actual filming, Cruise flew in the back seat of an F-14 with a pilot in the front seat, and
                    they performed real aerial maneuvers including high-G turns, rolls, and dives. The filming was done
                    using specially-designed cameras mounted on the fighter jets, which allowed for some stunning and
                    realistic footage of the planes in flight.

                <h3>IV : Film was inspired by a magazine article</h3>
                <p>"Top Guns" was a magazine article written by Ehud Yonay for California Magazine in 1983. The article
                    provided an inside look at the United States Navy&apos;s elite Strike Fighter Tactics Instructor
                    program,
                    which is commonly known as "Top Gun."
                </p>
                <p>
                    The article was based on Yonay&apos;s own experiences as a civilian journalist who was allowed to
                    attend the Top Gun school and observe the training firsthand. The article was highly praised for its
                    detailed and vivid descriptions of the training program, and for its insights into the mindset of
                    fighter pilots. It provided readers with a rare glimpse into the world of naval aviation, and helped
                    to popularize the Top Gun school and its methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The article was widely read and generated a lot of buzz in Hollywood, eventually catching the
                    attention of producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer. They saw the potential for a blockbuster
                    movie based on the Top Gun program, and hired screenwriter Jim Cash to write a script based on the
                    article.
